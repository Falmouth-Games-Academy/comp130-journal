Paper 1: Can you program ethics into a self-driving car? Noah J. Goodall http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/document/7473149/

Hardcoding roads laws is bad as it limits the vehicle and drivers normally will break the law to gain speed, and things such as positioning itself in a lane to avoid debree, and actively moving awawy from larger threats such as trucks to minamise risk, but transferring that risk to to other road users as they are closer to them. 

Due to the sheer amount of scenarious and problems that occur on roads, it will be  along time before each problem can be computed and taken into account.

Unfair treatment of road user as the car will avoid danger from dangerous drivers and move towards law abiding vehicles.

Would the car crash on purpose to save another person's life?
