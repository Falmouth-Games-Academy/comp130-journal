## Paper 1: Can you program ethics into a self-driving car? Noah J. Goodall 
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/document/7473149/

Hardcoding roads laws is bad as it limits the vehicle and drivers normally will break the law to gain speed, and things such as positioning itself in a lane to avoid debree, and actively moving awawy from larger threats such as trucks to minamise risk, but transferring that risk to to other road users as they are closer to them. 

Due to the sheer amount of scenarious and problems that occur on roads, it will be  along time before each problem can be computed and taken into account.

Unfair treatment of road user as the car will avoid danger from dangerous drivers and move towards law abiding vehicles.

Would the car crash on purpose to save another person's life? 

## Paper 2:Driving the self-driving vehicle: Expanding the technological design horizon Pascale-L. Blyth

Much as the same as the first paper, poses the Trolly Problem.

Should it kill an old person and spare a child, but the child may be taller than the young person? 

"SDVs are revolutionary and will infiltrate society in a more pervasive, broader, and potentially disruptive sense than other automated vehicle systems"

"if a city is not technologically-outfitted for SDVs, SDVs will not be able to drive properly." Meaning all of the major cities and towns will have to be reworked for SDV's but what about regular cars?

As with all technology, the higher prices model may be safer or better equipped than the lower priced model, causing classist roads, where the lower tier may be more dangerous. "“speed hierarchy”"
