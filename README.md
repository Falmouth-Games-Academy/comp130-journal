## Section 1 - Introduction
SDV(Self Driving Vehicles) technology has come a long way since it's early beginnings in the 90's, with teams such as ARGO and Navlab demonstrating "thousands of kilometres of highway driving at speeds up to 130 kph with normal traffic" [4], and although this may sound very much like what current SDV's are capable of, the technology used was all far too large and took up most of the room in the car that could be used to possibly seat passengers,  and the route the cars took were pre-planned with "highly accurate GPS way points" so this sort of test doesn't really have any sort of practicality in the real world, and was more used to show that the technology could work. However, thanks however to the continued miniaturisation of technology and the use of new technologies such as ultra high resolution cameras that can help spot pedestrians up to 97 meters away [6], (which can far outstrip that of some road users), SDV's are now something that is available to the general public, thanks in no small part to Tesla, who in 2015 allowed it's users to utilize the experimental "Autopilot" mode [3], and as such many other companies such as Google and the car giant Toyota started to invest and develop in SDV technology, but this sudden development didn't come without it's critiques, as the normal person and academics alike started to ask, can you program a SDV to have acceptable ethics?, and who is at fault when the vehicle makes a mistake?

Hardcoding roads laws is bad as it limits the vehicle and drivers normally will break the law to gain speed, and things such as positioning itself in a lane to avoid debree, and actively moving awawy from larger threats such as trucks to minamise risk, but transferring that risk to to other road users as they are closer to them. 

Due to the sheer amount of scenarious and problems that occur on roads, it will be  along time before each problem can be computed and taken into account.

Unfair treatment of road user as the car will avoid danger from dangerous drivers and move towards law abiding vehicles.

Would the car crash on purpose to save another person's life?

Much as the same as the first paper, poses the Trolly Problem.

Should it kill an old person and spare a child, but the child may be taller than the young person? 

"SDVs are revolutionary and will infiltrate society in a more pervasive, broader, and potentially disruptive sense than other automated vehicle systems"

"if a city is not technologically-outfitted for SDVs, SDVs will not be able to drive properly." Meaning all of the major cities and towns will have to be reworked for SDV's but what about regular cars?

As with all technology, the higher prices model may be safer or better equipped than the lower priced model, causing classist roads, where the lower tier may be more dangerous. "“speed hierarchy”"

"2015 lawsuit against Ford, GM, and Toyota accused the companies of “hawking vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers who could hypothetically wrest control of essential functions such as brakes and steering.” Meaning that hackers could easily turn the car into a weapon

GM's ignition-switch recall cost the company US 7 billion. For at least some autonomous-car defects, however, the recall could take the form of a software patch delivered wirelessly and inexpensively. Lowering the chance of recalls not being carried out and defects going on to cause harm. 

"THERE's A REASON to speed the rollout of autonomous vehicles. By replacing error-prone human drivers, autonomous driving technology can potentially save 30,000 lives each year in the United States alone. It can annually prevent 5 million accidents and 2 million injuries, conserve 7 billion liters of fuel, and save so many hundreds of billions of dollars in lost productivity and accident-related costs that the figures are beyond comprehension. That's because computer drivers are in principle fundamentally safer drivers. They never text, do their makeup, or fall asleep at the wheel. (Human error, in contrast, causes roughly 93 percent of crashes.) Robo-drivers can have 360-degree vision, and thanks to lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors, they can see through fog and in the dark."

"Computer drivers can have “telepathy”: A computer driver could let another computer driver know that it is considering changing lanes before making the decision to do so. It could communicate with traffic lights to minimize wait times at intersections and optimize traffic flow."

In the United States, over 42,000 people are killed and over 2.7 million people are injured each year1

"Maps also provide important contextual information. Consider figure 2a; without any context, the two vehicles appear to be on a collision course. Given context (see figure 2b), we can safely assume that one of the vehicles is just making a lane change and that nothing untoward is about to happen. Boss uses a model of the nearby roads in much the same way to anticipate and reason about other vehicles' movements."

"For individuals who have lost their driving privilege owing to age or disability, autonomous vehicles will remove the spatial barriers limiting them from interacting with family, friends, and the community."

"Only vehicles would be on the course, and they had to be midsized cars or larger. This removed pedestrians and bicycles from the scope."

"Our proposed solution to this issue is to acquire new knowledges. We consider that the locomotion is a source of experience which can be transformed in knowledges using learning technics. Once again the human driver example is follow. Starting with a basic collection of driving behaviors the human driving will acquire new skills using its experience."

"the second level mission is to solve situations which are probable but there are not anticipated by the previous level (a pedestrian which cross the road, an illegally maneuver of another driver etc.)"

"The tactical level will trigger a particular behavior in order to solve a particular locomotion problem."
